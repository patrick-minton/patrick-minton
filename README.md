### Hello!

<img align="left" width=340 height=512 src="https://github.com/patrick-minton/patrick-minton/blob/master/profile-photo.jpg"/>I'm a software engineering leader who's been in web development for a minute (my first job was at Amazon, when it still only sold books!). I have worked at firms of all sizes, from FAANGs to tiny startups.

Iâ€™m currently working on user and revenue growth for <a href="https://curology.com">Curology</a>.
